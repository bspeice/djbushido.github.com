 * \subsection libcvautomation Libcvautomation
 * Libcvautomation is a GUI automation and testing tool based on image recognition and response. This program was designed as a direct replacement for Sikuli and Xpresser. Each solution had large problems with crashing, and both refused to function on RedHat Linux and Ubuntu 12.04. I really liked the way each of these programs approached GUI automation, but they simply didn't work. As such, a simple library was designed to integrate OpenCV and XTest, which can be used by BASH to drive GUI testing and automation, that works on both new and old Linux distributions.

 * \subsection xplaylistcreator xplaylist_creator
 * XPlaylist_creator was a quick project to export an XMMS2 playlist to a .pls or .m3u format. This way you can re-integrate it later if your media library gets deleted, and use XMMS2 playlists elsewhere.
