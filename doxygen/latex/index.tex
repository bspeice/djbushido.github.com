\subsection{Libcvautomation}\label{index_libcvautomation}
Libcvautomation is a GUI automation and testing tool based on image recognition and response. This program was designed as a direct replacement for Sikuli and Xpresser. Each solution had large problems with crashing, and both refused to function on Red\-Hat Linux and Ubuntu 12.04. I really liked the way each of these programs approached GUI automation, but they simply didn't work. As such, a simple library was designed to integrate Open\-CV and XTest, which can be used by BASH to drive GUI testing and automation, that works on both new and old Linux distributions.

XPlaylist\_\-creator was a quick project to export an XMMS2 playlist to a .pls or .m3u format. This way you can re-integrate it later if your media library gets deleted, and use XMMS2 playlists elsewhere.\section{Questions? Comments?}\label{index_questions}
