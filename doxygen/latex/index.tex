\subsection{\-Libcvautomation}\label{index_libcvautomation}
\-Libcvautomation is a \-G\-U\-I automation and testing tool based on image recognition and response. \-This program was designed as a direct replacement for \-Sikuli and \-Xpresser. \-Each solution had large problems with crashing, and both refused to function on \-Red\-Hat \-Linux and \-Ubuntu 12.\-04. \-I really liked the way each of these programs approached \-G\-U\-I automation, but they simply didn't work. \-As such, a simple library was designed to integrate \-Open\-C\-V and \-X\-Test, which can be used by \-B\-A\-S\-H to drive \-G\-U\-I testing and automation, that works on both new and old \-Linux distributions.

\-X\-Playlist\-\_\-creator was a quick project to export an \-X\-M\-M\-S2 playlist to a .pls or .m3u format. \-This way you can re-\/integrate it later if your media library gets deleted, and use \-X\-M\-M\-S2 playlists elsewhere.
