Libcvautomation</a></h3>
Libcvautomation is a GUI automation and testing tool based on image recognition and response. This program was designed as a direct replacement for Sikuli and Xpresser. Each solution had large problems with crashing, and both refused to function on RedHat Linux and Ubuntu 12.04. I really liked the way each of these programs approached GUI automation, but they simply didn't work. As such, a simple library was designed to integrate OpenCV and XTest, which can be used by BASH to drive GUI testing and automation, that works on both new and old Linux distributions.

XPlaylist_creator was a quick project to export an XMMS2 playlist to a .pls or .m3u format. This way you can re-integrate it later if your media library gets deleted, and use XMMS2 playlists elsewhere.<h2><a class="anchor" name="questions">
